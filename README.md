# SinglePageApplication
Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are a kind of web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page based ont he user interaction. Single Page Applications are created with the help of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (mostly by using JavaScript frameworks or plugins like jQuery, AngularJS, KnockoutJS etc.).

SPAs are responsive web applications in nature and because of that it doesn't reloads the page on user interaction with the application. This means that much of the work happens on the cleint side using JavaScript.

This is a database driven "Single Page Application" that uses AngularJS and ASP.NET Web API. The database is LocalDB so no need of any installation and comes with the source code.

Feel free to use, modify or whatever you want.
